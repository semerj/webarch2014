** Secret :notes:
   + =telnet= will do this host lookup for us
   + BUT we still must speak proper HTTP: ie specifying the =Host= header
   + As if you were to see someone at an office. Drive to the office, but once
     you show up, have to tell front desk who you're there to see
   + Lot's of people in a building, lots of hosts on an IP
   + To get out of Telnet: ^], ^D

* Run webserver :slide:
#+begin_src bash
cd webarch2014
git checkout master
git pull jblomo master
git checkout -b hw4-telnet

./server/app.py
 * Running on http://127.0.0.1:60001/
#+end_src
 + http://people.ischool.berkeley.edu/~jblomo/server/home

* Proxy :slide:center:
  [[file:img/ischool-proxy.png]]
** people => app.py :notes:
   + Apache is proxying requests from your paths to your individual app.py
   + If your app.py is not running, will get an error
   + This is setup by Kevin in helpdesk, let us know if the mapping is not
     working

* Communicate with our webserver :slide:
  + Keep =server/app.py= running, open another window
