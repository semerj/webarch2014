SELECT

    1. How many links were added afer 2014-10-14?

    mysql> select count(*) from links where created > '2014-10-14';
    result: 12

    2. How many links that were added before 2014-10-14 have fewer than 40 hits?

    mysql> select count(*) from links where created < '2014-10-14' and hit_count < 40;
    result: 4

INSERT

    1. Insert your own URL with a date before 2014-10-14 with greater than 40 hits.

    mysql> insert into links (long_url, short_url, hit_count, created) values ('www.pizza.com', 'zaa', 41, '2014-10-13');

    2. Is it possible that someone querying the database at the same time could see your insert partially complete (eg. only see some fields filled in)? What database property is this related to? 

    No. This is related to the atomicity principle within ACID properties. My query/transaction would never be partially completed - it's all or nothing.

UPDATE

    1. Increment the hit_count for only your new row. What is the new count?

    mysql> update links set hit_count=hit_count+1 where long_url='www.pizza.com';
    result: 42
